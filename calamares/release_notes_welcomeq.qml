            text: qsTr("<h3>KaOS - 2021.08</h3>
            <p>KaOS is pleased to announce the availability of the August release of a new stable ISO.</p>
            
            <p>You will find Plasma 5.22 on this ISO. Highlights of this new major version include the big new feature Adaptive Transparency: This means the panel and panel widgets will usually be pleasantly translucent, but will become entirely opaque if there are any maximized window, a transition to Plasma System Monitor from the older KSysguard as the default system monitoring app and Plasma Wayland session now supports Activities: a classic feature unique to the Plasma desktop that allows you to have completely different environments for different aspects of your computing life, other KWin Wayland improvements include the Present Windows effect. New in Plasma 5.22, System Settings opens up on a speed dial page that gives you direct access to the most commonly used settings, as well as to the ones you have accessed most.</p>
            
            <p>The installer Calamares has two new QML modules.  KaOS has ported the Packagechooser to QML, resulting in a clearer and more consistent layout, and giving the option to fully translate this module in the normal Transifex location.  The offline Locale module is now also ready for QML. The regular Locale module uses an interactive map, needing a network connection, so it is good to have to offline QML option also fully working.</p>
            
            <p>As always with this rolling distribution, you will find the very latest packages for the Plasma Desktop, this includes Frameworks 5.83.0, Plasma 5.22.4 and KDE Applications 21.07.90. All built on Qt 5.15.2+.</p>
            
            <p>New applications added include Maliit virtualkeyboard packages.</p>
            
            <p>Updates to the base of this distribution were numerous and include a new ICU 69.1 & Boost 1.76.0 stack, Systemd 249.2, Glib2 2.68.3 with the whole glib/gobject group updated, Grub 2.06, Git 2.32.0, Hwids 20210613, Protobuf 3.17, Dracut 055, Poppler 21.08.0, Mesa 21.1.6, NetworkManager 1.32.6, ZSTD 1.5.0, Kmod 29.< /br>
            Qt 5.15 does not receive updates or maintenance from the Qt company (only closed source, paid support is available). KDE has stepped up though and published a maintained 5.15 fork https://dot.kde.org/2021/04/06/announcing-kdes-qt-5-patch-collection. KaOS now regularly does a patch update from this fork for all of Qt 5.15, so it basically is now at 5.15.3.</p>
            
            <p>Since LibreOffice 6.2, it is now possible to supply this as a pure Qt5/kf5 application.  LibreOffice has thus replaced Calligra as the default Office Application for KaOS.</p>
            
            <p>KaOS' creation <strong>Croeso</strong> (Welsh for welcome) for helping with configuring a new install is included.  It will run on the newly installed system and offers to adjust some 15 commonly used settings, includes a custom Wallpaper selector, distribution info, and the option to select packages to install from six different groups.  It is written in QML and fits well with the Welcome application used in the Live system.  The latter includes an Installation Guide.</p>
            
            <p>There is an option to verify the authenticity of downloaded KaOS ISO files through GPG signature verification, see the Download page for further details and instructions.</p>
            
            <p>A KaOS specific tool to write ISO files to USB is in use.  Not only does IsoWriter write to USB it also gives the option to recover your USB stick after using it for an ISO, something that regular dd copy or the previously used Imagewriter were not able to do. It includes the option to verify the written USB in comparison to the used ISO file.</p>
            
            <p>The artwork includes custom icon themes for light and dark themes. Midna and Midna Dark both create a complete unified look from boot-up all the way through logout.</p>

            <p>This ISO uses the <b>CRC and finobt enabled</b> XFS filesystem as default. CRCs enable enhanced error detection due to hardware issues, whilst the format changes also improves crash recovery algorithms and the ability  of  various  tools to validate and repair metadata corruptions when they are found.  The  free  inode  btree does not index used inodes, allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems age.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in tool to access <b>KCP</b> has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own foreign icon in the menu-bar. New added is the option to select custom icons for the systemtray.</p>
            
            <p>For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple, transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader.</p>
            
            <p>To learn more about the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <b>http://kaosx.us/</b>, <b>http://kaosx.us/about/</b>, and <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/</b> pages.</p>
            
            <p>To avoid any misunderstanding and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b> any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this see <b>http://kaosx.us/about/based/</b>. A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a final release, every ISO is merely a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea what is currently available:</p>
            
            <p>The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.83.0, Plasma 5.22.4, KDE Applications 21.07.90</b>, Linux 5.12.13, Systemd 249.2, Kmod 29, NetworkManager 1.32.6, LibreOffice 7.1.5, Krita 4.4.5, Elisa, Xorg-Server 1.20.13, Mesa 21.1.6, Glibc 2.33, GCC 10.3.0, non-free Nvidia 470 and Python3 3.8.11 to name a few.</p>
            
            <p>The package manager is <strong>Pacman 5.2.2</strong>, with the simple but powerful Octopi 0.11.0 as GUI frontend. Falkon is the default, Qt based, web browser. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork, Grub theme is Midna, Look &amp; Feel is a KaOS exclusive version Midna.</p>
            
            <p><b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about 2100-2200. A gist of what is available, besides the stable kernel there is Linux-next 5.11, Calligra 3.2.1, VLC, Vokoscreen, Blender, Kodi, Calibre, Sigil, Vulkan packages, a few games like 0ad and Knights.<br />
            A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are available, examples Firefox 90.0, Chrome 94, Ardour 6.8.0, Inkscape 1.1, GIMP 2.10.24 and Thunderbird 78.12.0.<br />
            Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox, LibreOffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9.6 is available as a rather complete group.</p>
            
            <p><b>Known issues:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some Intel CPU systems might have an issue kernelâ€™s entropy pool and have a long boot delay, if encountered add <strong>random.trust_cpu=1</strong> to the kernel boot line.
                <li>Installing on RAID is currently not possible</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the instructions from the <b>http://kaosx.us/download/</b> page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support Unetbootin or Rufus</b>, and DVDs need a burn speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.</p>")
